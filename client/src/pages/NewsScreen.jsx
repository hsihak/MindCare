              <p>Last November, CMHA launched the Act for Mental Health campaign in Ottawa, advocating for the Canada Mental Health Transfer. Despite its absence in April's budget, the campaign gained momentum, supported by national organizations and thousands of Canadians. Recent engagements with the new Minister of Mental Health signal hopeful progress.</p>

              <p>The Movember movement raises awareness for men's health, including mental health, challenging the stigma against emotional vulnerability in men. Men face higher suicide and substance abuse rates. Support involves creating a safe space for open conversations, validating experiences, and assisting in finding professional help. Resources are available through CMHA and Talk Suicide.</p>
